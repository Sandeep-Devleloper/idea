# Hostel Review and Management App

## Problem Statement

In undergraduate studies, finding a good hostel to stay in is a significant challenge for students in many areas. The common issues faced include:

- Lack of reliable information about hostel maintenance, food quality, facilities, and overall environment.
- Dependence on limited reviews from Google Maps or word-of-mouth recommendations from friends or strangers.
- Hostel owners face issues with problematic tenants.

## Proposed Solution

The idea is to create an app that bridges the gap between students and hostel owners, providing transparency and accountability for both parties. The app will have the following features:

### Key Features

1. **Personal Accounts**:
   - Each individual (student/tenant) will have a personal account with:
     - Basic information.
     - A rating based on feedback from previous hostel owners.

2. **Hostel Accounts/Groups**:
   - Each hostel will have an account or group where students currently staying there can join.
   - Students leaving a hostel will exit the corresponding group, ensuring up-to-date information.

3. **Hostel Ratings and Reviews**:
   - Students can rate and review various aspects of the hostel, including:
     - Facilities.
     - Food quality.
     - Maintenance.
     - Wi-Fi quality.
   - This provides transparency for prospective tenants.

4. **Owner Verification**:
   - Hostel owners can use the app to verify tenant ratings and history, helping them identify responsible tenants.

5. **Truthful Representation**:
   - Detailed reviews and ratings from tenants ensure that false claims made by owners can be identified.

### Challenge: Fake or Targeted Negative Reviews

- Fake or targeted negative reviews are a potential issue.
- Possible solutions to address this include:
  - Verification mechanisms to ensure reviews are from verified tenants.
  - Moderation and reporting tools to handle disputes.
  - Algorithms to detect and flag suspicious reviews based on patterns.

## Advantages

- **For Students**:
  - Access to authentic and detailed information about hostels.
  - A platform to share honest feedback.

- **For Hostel Owners**:
  - Information about prospective tenants.
  - Tools to address issues arising from problematic tenants.

## Conclusion

This app aims to solve a prevalent problem for students and hostel owners by creating a transparent platform for reviews and management. With proper verification and moderation, the app can become a trusted resource for the hostel community.
